# Lab 1.4 – Conditionals and Loops

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Use if, else-if, and else to control program flow.
- Combine Boolean and comparison operators in conditions.
- Implement loops (`for` and `while`) to repeat tasks.
- Understand the role of `break` and `continue` in loops.

---

## 📖 Pre-Lab Reading
- Review **1_4_Conditionals_Loops.pdf**
- Sections: "If Statements", "Logical Operators", "Loops"

---

## 🧰 Setup
- Open this folder in VS Code.
- Open `src/index.html` in Chrome → DevTools → Console.
- Edit only: `src/Lab1_4_ConditionalsLoops.js`

## 📝 Tasks

### 🔹 Part A – Conditionals
1. Create a variable `temperature` and assign it any number.
2. Write an **if/else** structure:
   - If `temperature > 85`, print "It's hot!"
   - If `temperature >= 60 && temperature <= 85`, print "It's mild."
   - Otherwise, print "It's cold!"
3. Add an **else if** for exactly `100` that prints "Boiling point!"
4. Create a variable `grade` (A–F) and print "Pass" if grade ≠ F.
5. Reflection: *Why does order matter in chained conditions?*

### 🔹 Part B – Loops
6. Write a **for loop** that counts from 1–5 and logs each number.
7. Write a **while loop** that counts down from 3–1.
8. Create a **for loop** that prints only even numbers (2–10).
9. Use **break** to stop the loop early when `i == 5`.
10. Reflection: *Which loop felt easier to use and why?*

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Use a nested loop to print a small 3×3 grid of `*`.
- Modify your `temperature` logic to include humidity.

## 🎟 Exit Ticket
1. Which conditional gave you the most trouble?
2. Why would `===` be safer than `==` when testing Boolean results?
3. What’s one real-world process that could use a loop?
